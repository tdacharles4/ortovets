Key Considerations:
Why Next.js + Shopify works well:
•	Next.js handles custom frontend experience (3D dog, custom layouts)
•	Shopify manages products, checkout, inventory, customer accounts
•	Clear separation of concerns
Critical Path Items:
•	Week 1: Get Shopify API keys and test integration early
•	Week 2: Confirm 3D dog feature scope (could be complex)
•	Week 3: Ensure appointment booking doesn't conflict with Shopify's customer data
•	Week 4: Buffer for unexpected issues
Recommendations:
1.	Daily standups between Person 1 & 2 (15 min)
2.	Friday client demos at end of each sprint
3.	Shopify admin training should start Week 1, not Week 4
4.	Consider a design system (Tailwind + shadcn/ui) for consistency
5.	The 3D dog feature might need scoping - is it just a viewer or interactive configurator?
